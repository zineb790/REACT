// Creating Our Routes
// Now we will will import the Route & Routes component into App, this will allow us define which of our components should render depending on the URL, we'll also import our pages for our routes.
// We will use the Route component to specify each route

// Params
// We are going to soon build out our currencies component which will allow us to select which currencies price we'd like to see. We will do this by injecting a variable in our Price routes path. (":symbol")
//The :symbol part is a URL Param, a variable in the url. Whatever is in that spot in the path will be accessible by using the useParams hook.
